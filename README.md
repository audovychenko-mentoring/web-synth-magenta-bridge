# Web Synth Magenta Bridge

A browser-based synth collection connected to Magenta RealTime 2 through a local bridge process.

This repo currently has a working browser-to-bridge-to-Magenta path:

- `apps/web`: Vite + React Web Audio synth collection.
- `apps/bridge`: local WebSocket bridge that calls the installed Python/MLX Magenta RT package and streams stereo Float32 PCM back to the browser.
- `native/magenta`: notes for the lower-latency C++ `RealtimeRunner` integration.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the web app at `http://localhost:5173` and keep the bridge running at `ws://localhost:8787`.

## Magenta Setup

The bridge expects Magenta RT to be installed in `.venv` and the model assets to exist under `~/Documents/Magenta/magenta-rt-v2/`:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install "magenta-rt[mlx]"
mrt models init
mrt models download
```

By default, the bridge uses `mrt2_base`. Override with:

```bash
MAGENTA_MODEL=mrt2_small npm run dev
```

## Integration Plan

The current bridge launches a short-lived Python generator per request. That gives us real Magenta audio immediately, but the next production step is a persistent native bridge using `magentart::core::RealtimeRunner`:

- plant/Web Synth events map to live note and parameter controls.
- `RealtimeRunner::read_audio_stereo(...)` streams generated audio back to the browser.
- optional audio phrase seeding can use `set_audio_prompt_samples(...)` or `prefill_state(...)`.

For realtime work, use the MacBook with Apple Silicon. `mrt2_small` is the reliable realtime target; `mrt2_base` should be benchmarked locally before relying on it.
